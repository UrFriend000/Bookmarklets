Alright, so baaasically, my friends hate our school internet security, (it sucks), buuuuut, we found an amazing solution. BOOMARKLETS
(All  rights for the bookmarklets, go to their owners, but we did make a few)

I definitely will be adding more to this in my free time.

To actually use the physical bookmarklet, go into your bookmarks bar, and press create a new bookmarklet. Next where you would put the site url, paste the javascript code.
